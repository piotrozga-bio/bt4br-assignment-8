# Percentage of Population Who Have Tried Marijuana for Selected Years

This project include an analysis of percentage of population who have tried marijuana for selected years. The main idea of the project was to improve upon the chart found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/comments/bemumv/this_chart_on_marijuana_usage/). The data were synthetically generated using python libraries to reflect the original values as closely as possible.
